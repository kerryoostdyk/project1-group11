Project 1 in Data Bootcamp

This project is an analysis of the "National Parks of the United States" data from Kaggle.com.  
Students used 3 driving questions to research, code, and create visualizations for this data set. 
The 3 questions are as follows:
What are the oldest parks in the country? 
How does the size of the park affect the number of visitors? 
How are the national parks distributed across the nation? 
Students concluded that park size and age are not related to visitor count.  The most visited parks are in the Eastern half of the country and the parks in the West are more widely spread out.
